    3: Biodiversity, Habitat Fragmentation, and Conservation (ES20-TE3)</h3>

    <h4>3.1 The Need for Intact Habitat and Measuring Biodiversity</h4>
    <p>Curriculum Outcome ES20-TE3 focuses on recognizing the need for intact habitat to support animal populations and overall biodiversity. Biodiversity is the variety of life at three levels: genetic diversity, species diversity, and ecosystem diversity. A high level of biodiversity increases the resilience of an ecosystem—its ability to recover from disturbances like disease or climate change. In Saskatchewan, the rapid conversion of native prairie to agricultural land has been the primary driver of biodiversity decline.</p>

    <h4>3.2 Habitat Fragmentation and Edge Effects</h4>
    <p>Habitat Fragmentation occurs when large, continuous habitats are divided into smaller, isolated patches by roads, fields, or urban development.</p>
    <p>- Edge Effects: The boundary zones (edges) between fragmented habitats (e.g., between a forest patch and an agricultural field) experience different environmental conditions (more wind, sun, and predation) than the deep interior. This reduces the effective size of the habitat patch, negatively impacting species that need large, undisturbed areas.</p>
    <p>- Reduced Gene Flow: Fragmentation can prevent animal populations from mixing, leading to inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity, making the population more vulnerable to extinction.</p>

    <p><strong>Case Study: Prairie Species Under Pressure</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia): An endangered species relying entirely on native grasslands, nesting in burrows. Its decline is a direct indicator of habitat loss and fragmentation.</li>
        <li>The Swift Fox (Vulpes velox): Once extirpated from Canada, this tiny fox relies on healthy, continuous short- and mixed-grass prairie. Reintroduction efforts depend heavily on managing land use and reducing human-caused mortality (like road deaths).</li>
        <li>The Greater Sage Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus): Highly sensitive to habitat disturbance, especially from human infrastructure (wells, roads). The male's elaborate courtship display requires large, open tracts of undisturbed land.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3.3 Conservation Strategies</h4>
    <p>Conservation efforts in Saskatchewan generally fall into two categories:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>In-situ Conservation (On-Site):</strong> Protecting species in their natural habitat. This includes creating Protected Areas (National Parks, Provincial Parks, Wildlife Refuges) and implementing Stewardship Agreements with landowners to protect critical habitats on private land.</li>
        <li><strong>Ex-situ Conservation (Off-Site):</strong> Protecting species outside their natural habitat. This includes captive breeding programs (like those used for the Swift Fox) and seed banks, which store genetic material for future use.</li>
    </ul>
